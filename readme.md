# Library with Spring Boot

Note:
'/getBooks' and '/getBooksByLetter' requests are implemented via single URL: 
    
    - '/lib/books' returns all the books' JSONs;
    - '/lib/books?letter=x' returns only the books which name starts with the letter parameter value;

Sample DB with 2 records is deployed automatically;
